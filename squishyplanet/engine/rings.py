def ring_para_coeffs(a, e, f, Omega, i, omega, rRing, ring_obliq, ring_prec, **kwargs):
    """
    Compute the coefficients describing the parametric form of a ring in the sky plane.

    Remember that ring_obliq and ring_prec are defined *in the planet's orbital plane, at f=0*.
    That implies that to get a face-on ring, you need ring_obliq=ring_prec=90 deg. Some other
    examples all at inc=90 deg:
    - ring_obliq=0, ring_prec=0: the ring is an edge-on horizontal line
    - ring_obliq=jnp.pi/4, ring_prec=0: the ring is still a line, but now it's tilted 45 degrees in the sky frame. You've tipped the north pole away from the star.
    - ring_obliq=0, ring_prec=anything: the ring is still a line
    - ring_obliq=90, ring_prec=0: the ring is a face-on circle
    Making inc != 90 deg will alter these: the angles are defined in the orbital plane,
    so if you tilt the orbit away from face-on, you'll also tilt the ring away from face-on.

    Args:
        a (Array): The semi-major axis of the planet.
        e (Array): The eccentricity of the planet.
        f (Array): The true anomaly of the planet.
        Omega (Array): The longitude of the ascending node of the planet.
        i (Array): The inclination of the planet.
        omega (Array): The argument of periapsis of the planet.
        rRing (Array): The radius of the ring.
        ring_obliq (Array): The ring_obliquity of the ring.
        ring_prec (Array): The ring_precession of the ring.

    Returns:

            form of the ring.

    The cartesian intersection points in the sky-planet between the projected planet and a ring edge.

    You need to provide the coefficients that describe the ring and the planet in the
    sky plane, one of which is in parametric form, and the other in implicit form,
    though it doesn't matter which is which.

    This is a more general version of `_single_intersection_point` in
    `polynomial_limb_darkened_transit`, which assume the second "ellipse" is the star.

    The rho coefficients satisfy the following equation for either the ring or the planet:

    .. math::
                \\rho__{xx} x^2 + \\rho__{xy} xy + \\rho__{x0} x + \\rho__{yy} y^2 + \\rho__{y0} y + \\rho__{00} = 1

    And the c coefficients describe the parametric curve of either the planet or the ring:

    .. math::
                x = c_x1 \\cos(t) + c_x2 \\sin(t) + c_x3
                y = c_y1 \\cos(t) + c_y2 \\sin(t) + c_y3

    Args:
        c_x1 (Array): Coefficient in the parametric form of the planet/ring.
        c_x2 (Array): Coefficient in the parametric form of the planet/ring.
        c_x3 (Array): Coefficient in the parametric form of the planet/ring.
        c_y1 (Array): Coefficient in the parametric form of the planet/ring.
        c_y2 (Array): Coefficient in the parametric form of the planet/ring.
        c_y3 (Array): Coefficient in the parametric form of the planet/ring.
        rho_xx (Array): Coefficient in the implicit form of the ring/planet.
        rho_xy (Array): Coefficient in the implicit form of the ring/planet.
        rho_x0 (Array): Coefficient in the implicit form of the ring/planet.
        rho_yy (Array): Coefficient in the implicit form of the ring/planet.
        rho_y0 (Array): Coefficient in the implicit form of the ring/planet.
        rho_00 (Array): Coefficient in the implicit form of the ring/planet.

    Returns:
        Tuple:
            A tuple of two arrays, the first array contains the x-coordinates of the
            intersection points, and the second array contains the y-coordinates of the
            intersection points. Imaginary roots of the quartic polynomial that
            correspond to no intersection are replaced with 999.
